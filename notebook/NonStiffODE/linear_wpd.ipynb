        "For these tests we will solve a diagonal 100 independent linear differential\nequations. This will demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation of the methods\nfor handling large systems, since the system is both large enough that array\nhandling matters, but `f` is cheap enough that it is not simply a game of\ncalculating `f` as few times as possible. We will be mostly looking at the\nefficiency of the work-horse Dormand-Prince Order 4/5 Pairs: one from\nDifferentialEquations.jl (`DP5`, one from ODE.jl `rk45`, and one from\nODEInterface: Hairer's famous `dopri5`).\n\nAlso included is `Tsit5`. While all other ODE programs have gone with the\ntraditional choice of using the Dormand-Prince 4/5 pair as the default,\nDifferentialEquations.jl uses `Tsit5` as one of the default algorithms. It's a\nvery new (2011) and not widely known, but the theory and the implimentation\nshows it's more efficient than DP5. Thus we include it just to show off how\nre-designing a library from the ground up in a language for rapid code and\nrapid development has its advantages.\n\n## Setup"
